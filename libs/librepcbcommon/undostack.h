/**
 * @brief The UndoStack class holds UndoCommand objects and provides undo/redo commands
 *
 * Instead of the Qt classes QUndoStack and QUndoCommand we use our own undo classes
 * #UndoStack and #UndoCommand because of the better exception handling and more
 * flexibility.
 *
 * @note Our classes work very similar to the equivalent classes of Qt, so please read the
 *       documentation of "Qt's Undo Framework" and classes QUndoStack and QUndoCommand.
 *       There is also a more detailed description here: @ref doc_project_undostack
 *
 * Compared with QUndoStack, the biggest differences are the following:
 *  - <b>Support for exceptions:</b> If an exception is throwed in a #UndoCommand object, this
 *    undo stack always tries to keep the whole stack consistent (update the index only if
 *    the last undo/redo was successful, try to rollback failed changes, ...).
 *  - <b>Removed support for nested macros (QUndoStack#beginMacro() and
 *    QUndoStack#endMacro())</b>: I think we do need this feature (but we have a similar
 *    mechanism, see next line)...
 *  - <b>Added support for exclusive macro command creation:</b> @todo Don't sure if this
 *    is a good way, we need some tests first... If the tests are successful, we should
 *    complete this documentation (explain how this feature works).
 *
 * @see #UndoCommand
 *
 * @author ubruhin
 * @date 2014-08-20
 *
 * @todo This class is not yet tested very well. Does it work correctly when destroying
 *       an #UndoStack object while the current index is not the index of the last command?
